# 📸👀 Ad View Detection Project

Welcome to the **Ad View Detection Project**! This innovative project is designed to determine whether people are looking at an advertisement banner and, if so, measure the duration of their attention. Our primary objective is to monitor and analyze the daily view time of advertisements. 

## 🌟 Why This Project?

Imagine walking past a digital billboard or a captivating ad banner. How often do you actually stop and look at it? And for how long? This project aims to answer these questions with precision. By strategically placing a camera near the advertisement, we can detect when people are looking directly at the banner. The camera captures real-time data, which our system then processes to measure the duration of each glance. 

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Camera Setup**: A camera is positioned near the advertisement banner.
2. **Face Detection**: The system uses advanced facial recognition technology to detect faces in the camera's field of view.
3. **Gaze Detection**: Once a face is detected, the system analyzes the gaze direction to determine if the person is looking at the banner.
4. **Time Measurement**: If a gaze is detected, the system starts a timer to measure how long the person maintains their attention on the advertisement.
5. **Data Analysis**: Collected data is analyzed to provide insights into the daily view duration of the advertisement.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Accurate Gaze Detection**: Utilizes cutting-edge algorithms to accurately determine gaze direction.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes data in real-time to provide immediate feedback.
- **Daily Reports**: Generates comprehensive reports on the total view duration each day.
